## Our aims:

- responsive layout
- accessible
- simple and aesthetic design

## Layout and colour scheme:

We opted for a mobile-first approach to building the site. This informed our decision to use a single-column layout for mobile devices, and a row layout for desktop screens.

We used the colour wheel to find colours that complement each other, and we agreed on three that we were happy to use for the site. We added a fourth later to add extra contrast to our h2 section headings. We also limited ourselves to using two fonts - Fugaz One and Source Sans Pro - for consistency and clarity.

We each contributed to the site design in different ways, and we documented these choices in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/bV337Wm28ExGq2NeL3hqnBhW/Personal-Colors?node-id=0%3A1

## Accessibility:

- contrasting colours
- attributes
- bold, large font
- easy keyboard navigation

## Issues we faced:

- We were over ambicious with the aditional features we tied to add;
    CSS transformation
- Git was a trial


## Lessons learned:
- need to comment code
- communication is key
- take more breaks
- Set a deadline on experimentation time 

## Errors and things to keep in mind in the future:
- Git is unforgiving
- styling wills
- leave proofing time at the end
